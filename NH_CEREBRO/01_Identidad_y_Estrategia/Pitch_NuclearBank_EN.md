"NuclearBank is not a commercial bank; it is Nuclear Hand’s **Internal Operating System**. We have built an automated infrastructure to manage finance, legal, and operations with military precision. It serves as our 'de-risking' engine, ensuring healthy margins and scalable execution so we can focus entirely on product innovation."

## 2. 1-Minute Spoken Pitch (The "Coffee" Pitch)
*Best for: In-person intros, Zoom calls, or voice notes (approx. 130-150 words).*

"Hi, I’m Carlos Cuenca Rodríguez, founder of Nuclear Hand. We are building **technology for the augmented human**—starting with non-intrusive wearables that respect your attention.

But we know the hardware game is hard. That’s why we built **NuclearBank**.

NuclearBank is our proprietary **Internal Operating System**. It’s not a bank for the public, but a backend infrastructure that automates our finances, supply chain, and legal compliance.

While others drown in operational chaos, NuclearBank allows us to execute with the precision of a software company. It de-risks the business, ensuring that every dollar invested has a predictable return.

We are looking for partners who understand that in hardware, **execution is the real product**. If you believe in rigorous, data-driven growth, we should talk."
